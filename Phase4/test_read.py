#### Acutal tester for the number of lines of code ####
# from read import read_old_bank_accounts

# def main():
#     accounts = read_old_bank_accounts("accounts.txt")
#     print("\nValid accounts parsed:")
#     for account in accounts:
#         print(account)

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()


#### Use to find the count of the lines for each character ####
# with open("accounts.txt", "r") as f:
#     for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
#         # Remove the newline character and count the rest
#         print("Line {}: {} characters".format(i, len(line.rstrip('\n'))))
